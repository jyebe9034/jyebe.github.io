Finally, I bought a new iPad Pro 4th 11inch.
I was dreaming that I have an iPad since last year.
But at that time, I didn't have enough money for buying them.
Now I'm working steadily and I paid pretty good.
I'm sooo excited now and I'm going to pick my iPad up in Applestore tomorrow.
Hopefully, I could learn some programming tomorrow night.
