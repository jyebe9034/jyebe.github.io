Sometimes I think about what is the meaning of a life.
I'm just wondering what is the reason that I try to be better me.
If there's no special reason, but why I need to try my best?
Everyday I ask myself.
what are you looking for? what do you really want to do?
Unfortunately, I can't answer it.
I feel pretty happy but at the same time I feel a bit of sad.
I can't even explain where my feeling come from.
How about your feeling?
Could you tell me what do you think about what is the meaning of a life?
I'm waiting for your comment.
Thanks for reading my first blog.
