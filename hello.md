### 2020-04-20 my first blog

Sometimes I think about what is the meaning of my life.
I'm just wondering what is the reason that I try to be better me.
If there's no special reason, but why I need to try my best?
Everyday I ask myself.
what are you looking for? what do you really want to do?
Unfortunately, I can't make any answer.
I feel pretty happy nowadays but I feel a bit of sad at the same time.
I can't even explain where my feeling came from.
How about your feeling?
Could you tell me what do you think about what is the meaning of your life?
I'm waiting for your comment.
Thanks for reading my first blog.
