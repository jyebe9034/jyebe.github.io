well where should I start my story?
Do you happen to have any question about how does people live?
Why do they work so hard?
What do they want?
Every single day I think about these questions.
And there's no currect answer.
But I'm just keep thinking cause I'm so curious.
I really want to know why do I live and work.
Hopefully I could get some proper answer oneday.
Then we'll talk again.
